# ESP Traffic Light Project
Designing a An electronic circuit "Traffic light" containing ESP32 and LED Lights 



## Introduction
This project simulates a traffic light using an ESP microcontroller, created with Wokwi. The project demonstrates the basic principles of traffic light control and how to use the ESP microcontroller to manage LED lights.
This project uses an ESP microcontroller to control a set of LEDs that simulate a traffic light system. The traffic light operates with standard green, yellow, and red signals.

## Components

- ESP microcontroller (ESP32)
- Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs
-  wires

## Circuit Diagram
